## Experience
**Data Science Intern @ Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Developed Selenium and LXML-based web-scraping tool to automate pulling data from public employee reviews sites. 
- Extracted trending themes in employee reviews data using NLTK and TF-IDF and created supplementary tables and visuals using Pandas and Seaborn to highlight yearly fluctuations.
- Converted and refined existing source code (SAS) using Python and SQL, generating viable datasets to train risk assessment models.
- Prepared, cleaned, and transformed data from financial institutions using Pandas and subsequently produced Tableau dashboards to showcase findings to examiners.

**Head Graduate Teaching Assistant for CIS 5450 (Big Data Analytics) @ University of Pennsylvania (_January 2023 - Present_)**
- Oversee a team of TAs in the ongoing, collaborative development of course material, planning, and structure. 
- Host recitations, review sessions, and weekly office hours to aid students with assignments and lecture concepts.
- Curate and grade course material, including exams and homework assignments. 
- Mentored six groups of three students on end-of-term projects through providing guidance and constructive feedback.

**Machine Learning Research Intern @ Argonne National Laboratory (_June 2021 - August 2021_)**
- Familiarized myself with computer vision techniques and convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture through reading documents, literature, and online resources and through asking questions. 
- Developed labeling algorithm using Numpy and OpenCV for processing time-lapsed images of snow rods to improve efficiency of image annotation tasks.
- Trained and assessed U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) on snow rod segmentation tasks using algorithm-labeled image data.

**Computational Chemistry Research Assistant @ Joel Bowman Research Group, Emory University (_August 2020 - August 2022_)**
- Designed, implemented, and tested Python graphical user interface (GUI) for running monomial symmetrization fitting software to enhance user experience.
- Explored alternate methods for identifying negative potentials in potential energy surface fits through assessing diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and artificially reduced masses.
- Cleaned and processed data using Scikit-learn and Pandas to assess coverage and identify patterns.
- Assisted Dr. Bowman in his Machine Learning in Chemistry capstone course. Introduced students to a relatively new topic through teaching the first lecture.


## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
