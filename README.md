# Welcome!

## Biography	
I am a second year graduate student in the [Scientific Computing Master's Program (SCMP)](https://pics.upenn.edu/masters-science-engineering-scientific-computing/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my Bachelor's at Emory University, where I studied Chemistry and Computer Science. My work and research experiences range from studying potential energy surfaces to developing analytics tools. My current interests are in applied machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning. Outside of work, I enjoy running and watching soccer and basketball.

## Education							       		

- **University of Pennsylvania**, Master of Science in Engineering, Scientific Computing (_May 2024_)	
- **Emory University**, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (_May 2021_)


## Experience
**Data Science Intern @ Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Developed Selenium and LXML-based web-scraping tool to automate pulling data from public employee reviews sites. 
- Extracted trending themes in employee reviews data using NLTK and TF-IDF and created supplementary tables and visuals using Pandas and Seaborn to highlight yearly fluctuations.
- Converted and refined existing source code (SAS) using Python and SQL, generating viable datasets to train risk assessment models.
- Prepared, cleaned, and transformed data from financial institutions using Pandas and subsequently produced Tableau dashboards to showcase findings to examiners.

**Head Graduate Teaching Assistant for CIS 5450 (Big Data Analytics) @ University of Pennsylvania (_January 2023 - Present_)**
- Oversee a team of TAs in the ongoing, collaborative development of course material, planning, and structure. 
- Host recitations, review sessions, and weekly office hours to aid students with assignments and lecture concepts.
- Curate and grade course material, including exams and homework assignments. 
- Mentored six groups of three students on end-of-term projects through providing guidance and constructive feedback.

**Machine Learning Research Intern @ Argonne National Laboratory (_June 2021 - August 2021_)**
- Familiarized myself with computer vision techniques and convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture through reading documents, literature, and online resources and through asking questions. 
- Developed labeling algorithm using Numpy and OpenCV for processing time-lapsed images of snow rods to improve efficiency of image annotation tasks.
- Trained and assessed U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) on snow rod segmentation tasks using algorithm-labeled image data.

**Computational Chemistry Research Assistant @ Joel Bowman Research Group, Emory University (_August 2020 - August 2022_)**
- Designed, implemented, and tested Python graphical user interface (GUI) for running monomial symmetrization fitting software to enhance user experience.
- Explored alternate methods for identifying negative potentials in potential energy surface fits through assessing diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and artificially reduced masses.
- Cleaned and processed data using Scikit-learn and Pandas to assess coverage and identify patterns.
- Assisted Dr. Bowman in his Machine Learning in Chemistry capstone course. Introduced students to a relatively new topic through teaching the first lecture.
