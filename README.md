# Welcome!

## Biography	
I am a second year graduate student in the [Scientific Computing Master's Program (SCMP)](https://pics.upenn.edu/masters-science-engineering-scientific-computing/) at the University of Pennsylvania. I obtained my Bachelor's at Emory University, where I studied Chemistry and Computer Science. My work and research experiences range from studying potential energy surfaces to developing analytics tools for businesses. My current interests are in applied machine learning, computer vision, and deep learning. Outside of work, I enjoy running, playing/watching soccer and basketball, and collecting sneakers.

## Education							       		

- **University of Pennsylvania**, Master of Science in Engineering, Scientific Computing (_May 2024_)	
- **Emory University**, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science (_May 2021_)


## Experience
**Data Science Intern @ Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Developed robust and efficient web scraping solution using Python, LXML, and Selenium that automated data retrieval tasks on public websites, improved data accuracy, and reduced manual efforts.
- Employed NLP techniques, specifically TF-IDF, to analyze large sets of employee reviews and identify insights and trends, providing stakeholders with valuable information on employee sentiments, concerns, and areas of improvement. 
- Performed comprehensive data preprocessing using Pandas to clean and prepare raw data from financial institutions, and subsequently produced interactive dashboards and visualizations in Tableau to showcase findings to examiners. 
- Converted and refined existing SAS source code to Python and SQL for generating viable datasets to train risk assessment models.


**Head Graduate Teaching Assistant for CIS 5450 (Big Data Analytics) @ University of Pennsylvania (_January 2023 - Present_)**
- Oversee a team of TAs in the ongoing, collaborative development of course material, planning, and structure. 
- Host recitations, review sessions, and weekly office hours to aid students with assignments and lecture concepts.
- Mentor six groups of three students on end-of-term projects by providing guidance and constructive feedback.
- Curate and grade course material, including exams and homework assignments. 

**Machine Learning Research Intern @ Argonne National Laboratory (_June 2021 - August 2021_)**
- Familiarized myself with computer vision techniques and convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture through reading documents, literature, and online resources and through asking questions.
- Produced a comprehensive pipeline using NumPy and OpenCV for time-lapsed image labeling and preprocessing that prepared input data for downstream segmentation tasks and significantly reduced manual efforts. 
- Actively collaborated in the training process of U-Net model in PyTorch for image segmentation of snow rods.

**Computational Chemistry Research Assistant @ Joel Bowman Research Group, Emory University (_August 2020 - August 2022_)**
- Designed, implemented, and tested a desktop GUI using Python and PyQt for running monomial symmetrization fitting software, ensuring a seamless user experience. 
- Explored alternate methods for identifying negative potentials in potential energy surface fits through assessing diffusion Monte Carlo calculations and artificially reduced masses.
- Cleaned and processed data using Scikit-learn and Pandas to assess coverage and identify patterns.
- Assisted Dr. Bowman in his Machine Learning in Chemistry capstone course. Introduced students to a relatively new topic through teaching the first lecture.


## Projects
### San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share EDA/ML Analysis
[GitHub](https://github.com/thejeffreyli/kaggle-sf-bay-area-bike-share)

In this project, we leverage data analytics tools and machine learning algorithms to understand the San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share data provided by Kaggle. Through our exploration, we study internal and external factors that impact bike share trip durations and uncover trends across both location, time, and weather-related factors. To understand relationships between stations and key trip factors, we first use k-means clustering as an unsupervised learning method. We consider both regression and classification-based models given we have real inputs and want to predict trip durations as a continuous variable or as a categorical binary variable (i.e., short and long trips). We employ grid search cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning in order to improve our classification model and also present our final models.
